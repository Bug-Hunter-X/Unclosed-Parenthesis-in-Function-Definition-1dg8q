This repository demonstrates a common Python error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version.  The error results in a `SyntaxError`, preventing the code from running. The solution involves carefully reviewing and correctly closing all parentheses used in function definitions and throughout your code.
